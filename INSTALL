QUICK GUIDE
===========

To build uftrace, you need to install basic software development tools first -
like gcc and make.  And also you need to install dependent softwares, please
see DEPENDENCY section for details.

Once you installed required software(s), you can run `make' to build it.

    $ make

It builds uftrace and resulting binary exists in the current directory.
This is good for testing, but you'll want to install it for normal use.

    $ sudo make install

It installs the uftrace under /usr/local by default, if you want install it
to other location, you can set prefix variable when invoking make.

    $ make prefix=/usr
    $ sudo make install


DEPENDENCY
==========

Currently uftrace depends on libelf from elfutils project for ELF symbol
manipulation.  You need to install it first in order to build uftrace.

On debian based systems (like Ubuntu), libelf-dev package will provide
required libraries/files.

    $ sudo apt-get install libelf-dev

On redhat based systems (like Fedora, RHEL), it'll be elfutils-libelf-devel.

    $ sudo yum install elfutils-libelf-devel
