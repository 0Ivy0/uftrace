QUICK GUIDE
===========

To build ftrace, you need to install basic software development tools first -
like gcc and make.  And also you need to install dependent softwares, please
see DEPENDENCY section for details.

Once you installed required software(s), you can run `make' to build it.

    $ make

It builds ftrace and resulting binary exists in the current directory.
This is good for testing, but you'll want to install it for normal use.

    $ sudo make install

It installs the ftrace under /usr/local by default, if you want install it
to other location, you can set prefix variable when invoking make.

    $ make prefix=/usr
    $ sudo make prefix=/usr install


DEPENDENCY
==========

Currently ftrace depends on libelf from elfutils project for ELF symbol
manipulation.  You need to install it first in order to build ftrace.

On debian based systems (like Ubuntu), libelf-dev package will provide
required libraries/files.

    $ sudo apt-get install libelf-dev

On redhat based systems (like Fedora, RHEL), it'll be elfutils-libelf-devel.

    $ sudo yum install elfutils-libelf-devel

And there's an optional dependency for demangling C++ symbols to libiberty.
You need to install related package to enable that feature.

    $ sudo apt-get install libiberty-dev

or

    $ sudo yum install binutils-devel
